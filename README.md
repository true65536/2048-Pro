# 2048 Pro
2048 Variants Just Got Extended! Try The New "2048 Pro" and HAVE FUN! :)
A small clone of 2048, originally by Gabriele Cirulli, which is conceptually similar to Threes! by Asher Vollmer.

Check the original developer of this game, Gabriele Cirulli's official 2048 on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielecirulli.app2048) and on the [App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805)

## Disclaimer
This site is a clone of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which itself is based on [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), and conceptually similar to [Threes](https://asherv.com/threes/).

**NEW:** I added 2 other clones of 2048 - [2147483648](https://true65536.github.io/2048-Pro/size8.html) and [9007199254740992](https://true65536.github.io/2048-Pro/size16.html). The first one can support grid sizes up to 8x8, and the second one has cooler designs and a 16x16 grid! I also added Lucas numbers (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76...) and 2047 (you put tiles in grid and randomly moves the grid) to the game and it is available on all 2048 Pro sites. The game has been modified for endless gameplay too!

***Update***: Added 2048 Chemistry variants, in which two adjacent tiles with the same element can merge to form a tile of the next element. For example, two Selenium (Se) tiles can merge to form a Bromine (Br) tile.

The 4 new elements renamed 2 years ago are: 
* **Nihonium** and symbol **Nh**, for the element 113,
* **Moscovium** and symbol **Mc**, for the element 115,
* **Tennessine** and symbol **Ts**, for the element 117, and
* **Oganesson** and symbol **Og**, for the element 118.

Previous update: Minor text fixes on some games.

## Project work?
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub, which means there are no hosting costs.

Enjoy the game!

Man, the highest record in Threes is 832K, by the way. I never reached 6144.

Plus 144 is a Fibonacci number. :smile:
